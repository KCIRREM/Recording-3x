# Recording-3x
This is a basic project for recording 3 audio streams from browsers at once on which the audio is not detectable/playable through html5. There's probably a better way to do this but programs spawning from the same initial program cannot be separately edited in the audio mixer however this might be possible with isolated installations of the same program; currenly working on a fork for linux as the current solution is very ugly. It relies oon three separate browsers along with three VB cable packages which isn't ideal but with linux I can create dummy drivers to route audio on the fly allowing me to also channel one application through diffrent inputs based on tabs (hopefully).
